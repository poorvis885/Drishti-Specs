## 🧠 About the Project

India is home to over **30 million** visually impaired people, many of whom live in **rural areas** where internet access is limited and tech solutions are expensive or language-restricted.

**Drishti Specs** is a wearable smart glasses concept designed to bridge the accessibility gap using:

- 🎯 **YOLOv5** for real-time object detection (obstacles, stairs, animals, pits, etc.)
- 🗣️ Voice assistance in **regional Indian languages** (Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, etc.)
- ⚡ **100% offline functionality** for use in low-connectivity areas
- 🔋 **Battery backup** of over **10 hours** for day-long use

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Despite AI advancements, most visual aid tech is:
- Too **costly**
- Requires **internet access**
- Limited to **English or major languages**
- **Not inclusive** for rural users or those with minimal education
